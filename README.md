# CHIP8 EMULATOR

This is a chip8 Emulator that was written in C11 and SDL2. Chip8 is an interpreted programming language
developed by Joseph Weisbecker in the mid 1970's. Chip8 was originally developed for the COSMAC VIP and
TELMAC 1800 8-bit microcomputers. Made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.
Later on they would start to appear for some models of graphing calculators.
